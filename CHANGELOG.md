# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## 1.8.0 – 2026-07-01
### Changed
- Modernised PHP 7.4-style classes to PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `SuiteCRMWidget`, `Settings\Personal`, `Settings\Admin` (property docblocks removed, all readonly-style dependencies now declared in the constructor signature)
- README rewritten as a proper user-facing document: feature list, requirements, install/config instructions, development workflow, contributing pointer, updated license credit — replaces the previous ~30-line placeholder

### Deferred
- Iteration 6 (NC Mail contact card via `IMailContactProvider`) — depends on `nextcloud/mail` being installed for meaningful testing; will land after a docker-based test environment is stood up
- Full l10n restoration (Transifex or committed `en.json` baseline) — English strings work fine as fallback; deferred until translations are actually needed

## 1.7.0 – 2026-07-01
### Added
- **composer.json** for PHP tooling (PHPUnit 10, PHPStan 1.11, nextcloud/ocp stubs, PSR-4 autoload for `OCA\SuiteCRM\`)
- **phpunit.xml** with tests/php coverage of lib/
- **phpstan.neon** at level 5 covering all of lib/ (Application.php excluded because it depends on OC AppFramework stubs that don't survive plain analyse without a live NC codebase)
- **Test suite**:
  - `TokenStorageTest`: encryption on write, decryption on read, backward-compat plaintext migration, clear-all, empty-string short-circuits
  - `RecordUrlParserTest`: 5 valid-URL data-provider cases (query-string ordering, HTML-encoded ampersands, embedded in prose, mixed case), 6 rejection cases, module list assertion
- Extracted `RecordUrlParser` from `SuiteCRMReferenceProvider` as a pure static class — testable without instantiating IConfig/IL10N/IURLGenerator/etc.
- CI workflow expanded to run PHPUnit across PHP 8.1/8.2/8.3 and PHPStan on 8.2

### Changed
- CI workflow renamed to "Lint & Test"

## 1.6.0 – 2026-07-01
### Added
- **Reference provider** for SuiteCRM record URLs: paste a link like `.../index.php?module=Contacts&record=abc-123` into Talk, Notes, Deck, or any Nextcloud text field and it renders a rich card with the record's name and key attributes
- **Smart picker support**: the same provider implements `ISearchableReferenceProvider`, so the `@` smart picker in Talk/Notes exposes SuiteCRM as a search source (reusing the same `SuiteCRMSearchProvider`)
- Provider is registered via `IRegistrationContext::registerReferenceProvider` and cached per-user with the record's module:id key
- Supported modules for reference cards: Contacts, Accounts, Leads, Opportunities, Cases, Meetings, Calls, Tasks

## 1.5.0 – 2026-07-01
### Added
- New **SuiteCRM calendar** Nextcloud dashboard widget listing today's + next-7-days Meetings, Calls, and Tasks assigned to the current user, sorted chronologically
- `SuiteCRMAPIService::getUpcoming()` — data-driven fetch across Meetings/Calls/Tasks with server-side date + assignee filters; returns rows tagged with `type` and a normalised `event_ts` for client-side sorting
- New `GET /apps/integration_suitecrm/upcoming` endpoint
- Vue component `Calendar.vue` with the same visibility-loop pattern as the reminders widget

### Changed
- Widget order: reminders widget stays at order 10, the new calendar widget at order 20

## 1.4.0 – 2026-07-01
### Added
- Unified search now covers **Meetings**, **Tasks**, and **Emails** in addition to Contacts / Accounts / Leads / Opportunities / Cases
- Meeting results show start date; Task results show due date and priority; Email results show the sender name
- Cases show their case number in the subline

### Changed
- `SuiteCRMAPIService::search()` refactored to a data-driven loop over a `SEARCH_MODULES` table — new modules can be added by appending a single row
- `SuiteCRMSearchProvider` result formatting replaced repeated if/elseif chains with a `TYPE_TO_MODULE` map and `match()` expressions

### Fixed
- Regex-injection vulnerability in search: the user query was interpolated directly into `preg_match()`. Now passed through `preg_quote()` — searches for characters like `.`, `/`, `(`, `?`, `+` no longer break the pattern or throw

## 1.3.0 – 2026-07-01
### Changed
- Modernised the settings UI to the Nextcloud v9 design system: replaced raw `<input>` and native `<button>` elements with `NcTextField`, `NcPasswordField`, `NcButton`, `NcCheckboxRadioSwitch`, and `NcNoteCard`
- Replaced legacy icon-class markup with Material Design icons from `vue-material-design-icons` (Login, Logout, CheckCircle, ContentCopy, KeyPlus, OpenInNew, CalendarSync)
- Adopted v9 prop naming: `v-model` on inputs, `variant` on buttons, `modelValue`/`update:modelValue` on switches
- Personal + Admin settings now inherit dark-mode, focus-ring, and accessibility styling from the design system automatically

### Added
- New `vue-material-design-icons` dependency

## 1.2.0 – 2026-07-01
### Added
- TokenStorage service: OAuth access tokens + refresh tokens are now encrypted at rest via OCP\Security\ICrypto
- Backward-compatible plaintext-to-encrypted migration on first read for installs upgraded from <= 1.1.x
- Calendar Companion panel in Personal Settings exposing Nextcloud URL, login, and a deep link to /settings/user/security for app-password generation — feeds the per-user setup flow of the [suitecrm_nextcloud_calendar](https://github.com/njordium/suitecrm_nextcloud_calendar) SuiteCRM-side module
- GitHub Actions CI: lint + build (JS) and php -l (PHP 8.1/8.2/8.3) on push and PR

### Changed
- All token reads/writes now go through TokenStorage (ConfigController, SuiteCRMAPIController, SuiteCRMAPIService, SuiteCRMSearchProvider)
- Fixed CospendSearchProvider copy-paste docblock in SuiteCRMSearchProvider

## 1.1.0 – 2026-06-30
### Changed
- Fork: updated Nextcloud compatibility to NC25–34
- Migrated frontend from Vue 2 to Vue 3
- Updated all @nextcloud/* dependencies to current versions (axios v2, dialogs v5, vue v8, etc.)
- Replaced deprecated `Vue.prototype` globals with `app.config.globalProperties`
- Replaced `DashboardWidget`/`EmptyContent` (vue-dashboard) with `NcDashboardWidget`/`NcEmptyContent` from @nextcloud/vue
- Replaced `beforeDestroy` with `beforeUnmount` (Vue 3)
- Replaced `::v-deep` with `:deep()` (Vue 3)
- Moved notifier registration from Application constructor to `register()` (NC25+ best practice)
- Bumped Node engine requirement to >=20
